## Myself (Nikolas Karinja)

I'm an aspiring human that is looking for a solid and challenging programming job. Programming has been my passion due to me being an over-achiever and someone who loves to create their very own worlds in a digital space. My main reason that I began programming was to create games from scratch.

## Demos

Below is a list of demos that you can try. Most of them utilize my very own [Mystic Engine](https://github.com/gearshiftstudios/mystic-engine)

- **Description** - Made using my very own **[Mystic Engine](https://github.com/gearshiftstudios/mystic-engine)**, it generates a map ranging from **250 Tiles Squared** to **1000 Tiles Squared**. Default it generates a _Biome map_ and _Height Map_ with _animated water_ and many _trees_. It handles the _trees_ by using **Instanced Meshes** and the _animated water_ using the **[GSAP Library](https://greensock.com/)**. It is very detailed and has many pretty things to notice about it. Mostly every setting can be changed using the _Control Menu_ which utilizes **[dat.GUI](https://github.com/dataarts/dat.gui)**.
- **Performance** - On a average computer it can run **250 Tiles Squared** to **500 Tiles Squared** with no problems. However, anything above that may result in frame-drops and decreased performance. The _animated water_ may also cause decreased performance based on your computer specs (it can be turned off though in the _Control Menu_).
